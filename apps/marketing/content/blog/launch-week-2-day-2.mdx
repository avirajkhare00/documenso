## Introducing Templates

It's day 2 of Launch Week, everybody ðŸ™Œ After introducing [Teams](https://documenso.com/blog/launch-week-2-day-1) yesterday, today we are looking at making Documenso faster for daily use:
We are launching templates for Documenso! Templates are an easy way to reuse documents you send out often with just a few clicks. With templates, you can:

    alt="Template recipients quick fill view"

- Save often-uploaded documents for reuse
- Pre-define fields, so you just have to send the document
- Quickly fill out recipients and roles for new documents
- Share templates with your team to make working together even easier

## Pricing

Templates are **included in all Documenso Plans!** That includes our free tier: The limit of 5 documents per month still applies, but you are free to reach it with less friction using templates. Sharing templates with other users is only possible with the teams plan. If you want to share templates with people not in your team, we might have something coming up later this week ðŸ‘€

## What's Next for Templates

We have a lot of great stuff coming up for templates as well:

- More Field Types are in the pipeline
- Sharing Templates Externally ðŸ‘€
