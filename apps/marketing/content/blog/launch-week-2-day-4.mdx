## Introducing Zapier for Documenso

Day 4 ü•≥ Yesterday we introduced our [public API](https://documen.so/day3) for developers to build on Documenso. If you are not a developer or simple want a quicker integration this is for you: Documenso now support Zapier Integrations! Just connect your Documenso account via a simple login flow with Zapier and you will have access to Zapier's universe of integrations üí´ The integration currently supports:

- Document Created ([https://documen.so/zapier-created](https://documen.so/zapier-created))
- Document Sent ([Chttps://documen.so/zapier-sent](https://documen.so/zapier-sent))
- Document Opened ([https://documen.so/zapier-opened](https://documen.so/zapier-opened))
- Document Signed ([https://documen.so/zapier-signed](https://documen.so/zapier-signed))
- Document Completed ([https://documen.so/zapier-completed](https://documen.so/zapier-completed))

> ‚ö°Ô∏è You can create your own Zaps here: https://zapier.com/apps/documenso/integrations

Each event comes with extensive meta-data for you to use in Zapier. Missing something? Reach out on [Twitter / X](https://twitter.com/eltimuro) (DM open) or [Discord](https://documen.so/discord). We're always here and would love to hear from you :)

## Also Introducing for Documenso: Webhooks

To build the Zapier Integration, we needed a good webhooks concept, so we added that as well. Together with your Zaps, you can also now create customer webhooks in Documenso. You can try webhooks here for free: [https://documen.so/webhooks](https://documen.so/webhooks)
