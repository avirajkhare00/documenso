## Introducing the public Documenso API

Launch. Week. Day. 3 ðŸŽ‰ Documenso's mission is to create a platform that developers all around the world can build upon. Today we are releasing the first version of our public API, and we are pumped. Since this is the first version, we focused on the basics. With the new API you can:

- Get Documents (Individual or all Accessible)
- Upload Documents
- Delete Documents
- Create Documents from Templates
- Trigger Sending Documents for Singing

You can check out the detailed API documentation here:

> API DOCUMENTATION: [https://app.documenso.com/api/v1/openapi](https://app.documenso.com/api/v1/openapi)

## Pricing

We are building Documenso to be an open and extendable platform; therefore the API is included in all current plans. The API is authenticated via auth tokens, which every user can create at no extra cost, as can teams. Existing limits still apply (i.e., the number of included documents for the free plan). While we don't have all the details yet, we don't intend to price the API usage in itself (rather the accounts using it) since we want you to build on Documenso without being smothered by API costs.
