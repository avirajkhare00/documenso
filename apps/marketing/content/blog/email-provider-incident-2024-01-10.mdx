On January 10th, 2024 we were notified by our email provider that a security incident had occurred. This security incident which had started on January 7th led to a bad actor obtaining access to their database which contains ours and other customerâ€™s data.

We understand that during this security incident the following has been accessed:

- Email addresses.
- Metadata on emails sent excluding the email body.

While the incident is unfortunate we are pleased with the remediation and the processes that our email provider has put in place to help avoid this kind of situation in the future. Since the incident, our provider has rectified the issue and has engaged a security company to conduct an exhaustive investigation and to help improve their security posture moving forward.

We remain steadfast in our commitment to our current email provider, and will not be taking any further action with relation to changing providers.

We are now working with our legal counsel to ensure that we provide the appropriate notice to all our customers in each jurisdiction. If you have any further questions on this incident please feel free to contact our support team at [support@documenso.com](mailto:support@documenso.com).

We appreciate your ongoing support in this matter.
